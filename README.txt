Rocket Evolution in Python
(The original version was written in ISL, Racket)

This version allows optional simulation without gui, which significantly reduces the time it takes to execute large number of simulations.


Note:

Although Python enables more freedom and “control” over the program, these come with the cost of increased likelihood of bugs. 
It’s difficult to keep track of all the variables, once they are referred to in various modules/functions. 


Ideally, the next steps would be:

	- Implement a data collection program
	- Visualize the data during simulation with gui(this might cost a lot of running speed).
